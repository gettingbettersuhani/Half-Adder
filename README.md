# Half-Adder
A half adder is a fundamental digital logic circuit that performs the arithmetic addition of two single binary digits. It has two inputs and two outputs.
Inputs: A and B (the two bits to be added).
Outputs: Sum (S) and Carry (C).

It's called a "half" adder because it cannot accept a carry-in from a previous addition, which is required for adding multi-bit numbers.
